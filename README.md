# mesh_decimation
+ The project implements an algorithm to simplify a 3D mesh model, such that the new model will have less vertices/edges/faces but still best resembles the appearance of the original model.
+ User will input the target number of triangular faces of the new model, the program will automatically and intelligently reduce the original model to have the input target number of faces.
+ The sample usage code and also the main entrance of the project is provided in the file "DecimationVS6.cpp".
